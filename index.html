                    <p class="post-meta">
                        Diversity is a crucial aspect of the tech industry. Hiring employees from a wide range of
                        backgrounds will allow companies to build products useful for a variety of consumers - “the
                        greater the representation, the higher the likelihood of outperformance” (McKinsey). Despite the
                        advantages, the tech industry remains not nearly as diverse as its users. Below, we highlight
                        the main categories of disparity: gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, and education.

                    <h2 class="post-title">Gender</h2>
                    <p class="post-meta">
                        While women make up 47% of the employed U.S. population, only 25% of positions in tech are held
                        by women. The most common path to tech is through a STEM degree. As of 2020, women make up 45%
                        of those who received a STEM degree, but within STEM, only 16% and 21% of computer science and
                        engineering degree recipients, respectively, are held by women. In the workplace, females also
                        receive 13% lower salaries than their male counterparts. Alarmingly, over 50% of women have
                        reported experiencing inequality, discrimination, and/or sexual harrassment.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="post-title">Percentage of women in engineering fields over time</h4>
                    <div id="chartdiv"></div>
                    <p>
                        Despite these concerning statistics, over the past decade, the percentage of women in
                        engineering fields has been steadily decreasing. Software developers, one of the most
                        high-demand jobs, has seen nearly a 5% decrease the the percentage of women. This is
                        discouraging, as we've seen a plethora of companies succeed under the leadership and employement
                        of gender-diverse companies. 23andMe, with 51:49 female to male ratio and guaranteed equal
                        gender pay, has made incredible progress in genetic research and achieved consistently
                        increasing profit over the past years. Likewise, Etsy, with 56% of female employees and 87%
                        women entrepreneurs, has revolutionized the way people buy and sell handmade goods and exceeded
                        Wall Street expectations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given these trends, it’s clear that gender disparity occurs at all parts of the journey to
                        become a contributor in tech and is worsening over the years. At the hiring level,
                        inequalities should be addressed to support gender diversity.

                    <h3 class="post-title">Root cause of gender bias: Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        Overall, women are doing better than ever, where education is concerned. According to recent
                        trends, women are more likely than men to be enrolled in college, with nearly 67% of all college
                        students identifying as female. Women are also more likely to earn diplomas, with college
                        completion rates now reaching 65%!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, these on-the-rise figures don’t reach many tech fields, and some numbers seem to spiral
                        backward. In the mid-1980s, 37% of computer science majors were women; now, it’s dipped to 16%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to the 2018-2019 report from the National Center of Educational Statistics, women make
                        up only 21.31% of engineering graduates with a bachelor’s, 28.44% with a master’s, and 24.39%
                        graduate with a doctorate. The fields of study we’ve considered are computer and information
                        sciences, Engineering and engineering technologies, and a few interdisciplinary studies like HCI
                        and Systems Engineering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, a Google survey reported that the perpetuated influence of this retrograde thinking
                        and biases has significantly impacted future generations of young women in tech, some
                        of whom now believe that computer science is not essential.

                    <p>The chart illustrates the ethnic breakdown for some of the top tech companies today, with the
                        default graph showing the breakdown for white employees. The first bar shows the population of
                        that race/ethnicity in the U.S., providing a point of reference.

                    <!-- Create a div where the graph will take place -->
                    <div id="my_dataviz"></div>
                    <p> The data showed that Asians make up about 29% of tech employees, while only constituting 6% of
                        the US population. Latinos make up 18% of the U.S. population, but only around 7% of tech
                        employees. Similarly,
                        Black people make up 13% of the population, but only 5% of tech employees. This pattern persists
                        and becomes even greater in higher, leadership roles within companies. It is clear Latino and
                        Black people are under-represented minorities in tech.
                    </p>
                    <p> There are several problems that contribute to this discrepancy, including unequal access to
                        resources and implicit bias in the hiring process. There have been numerous studies which show
                        that employers are much more likely to call back applicants with “white” names than an applicant
                        with the same qualifications/resume but with “black” names. While more attention has been placed
                        on diversity and inclusion, there still remains a large gap for improvement.

                    <h2 class="post-title">Socioeconomic background</h2>
                    <p>This chart illustrates the correlation between socioeconomic background and employment into tech
                        companies as well as further enrollment into higher education. Socioeconomic status was measured
                        by a composite score of parental education, occupations, and family income.
                        Its x axis is divided into fifths, with the leftmost being the lowest fifth and the rightmost
                        being the lowest fifth.

                    <div id="chart-socioecon-div"></div>
                    <p>
                        The statistics shows that there is a noticeable increase and disparity in unemployment and
                        lack of enrollment in further education as you go towards the lowest fifth, specifically going
                        from 5 to 26 for both. This shows that those who have more opportunities from their
                        socioeconomic background do have an advantage and greater likelihood of entering the tech field.

                    <h2 class="post-title">Takeaways</h2>
                    <p>What can the tech industry do now to close the gender gap?</p>
                    <h5 class="bold">Amplify Minority's Voices</h5>
                    <p>In tech—as in all other workplaces—we need to amplify aggressively. Listen to minorities,
                        actively include them in conversations and give credit where it’s (desperately) due. The
                        company’s
                        business and the quality of the work environment will only improve.</p>
                    <h5 class="bold">Ditch the Damaging Dialogue</h5>
                    <p>The seemingly-harmless remarks are anything but benign. They’re not merely worn-out phrases;
                        they’re affronts perpetuating harmful stereotypes and fostering an atmosphere of prejudice.
                        After all, it’s one of the significant issues: 39% of women say that gender bias in the
                        workplace is why they’re underrepresented in technology.</p>
                    <h5 class="bold">Acknowledge Faults and Address Them</h5>
                    <p>Google is an excellent example of this. The tech giant is no stranger to the gender gap. Its
                        workforce is only 33% female, and nearly 72% of its leadership is male. And in 2017, the company
                        faced lawsuits from former female employees who alleged the tech giant enacted systemic pay
                        discrimination and the denial of promotions and other growth opportunities. However, since the
                        release of these statistics and the litigation news, Google has made strides
                        to improve its numbers and work culture. In 2014, it announced a $50 million investment in
                        programs that would help spark girls’ interest in STEM education, including a “Made With Code”
                        campaign and partnerships with Girls Who Code, Black Girls Code, and the Girl Scouts of America.
