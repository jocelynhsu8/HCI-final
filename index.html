                    <p class="post-meta">
                        Diversity is a crucial aspect of the tech industry. Hiring employees from a wide range of
                        backgrounds will allow companies to build products useful for a variety of consumers - “the
                        greater the representation, the higher the likelihood of outperformance” (McKinsey). Despite the
                        advantages, the tech industry remains not nearly as diverse as its users. Below, we highlight
                        the main categories of disparity: gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, and education.

                    <p class="post-meta">
                        While women make up 47% of the employed U.S. population, only 25% of positions in tech are held
                        by women. The most common path to tech is through a STEM degree. As of 2020, women make up 45%
                        of those who received a STEM degree, but within STEM, only 16% and 21% of computer science and
                        engineering degree recipients, respectively, are held by women. In the workplace, females also
                        receive 13% lower salaries than their male counterparts. Alarmingly, over 50% of women have
                        reported experiencing inequality, discrimination, and/or sexual harrassment.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="post-title">Percentage of women in engineering fields over time</h4>
                    <div id="chartdiv"></div>
                    <p>
                        Despite these concerning statistics, over the past decade, the percentage of women in
                        engineering fields has been steadily decreasing. Software developers, one of the most
                        high-demand jobs, has seen nearly a 5% decrease the the percentage of women. This is
                        discouraging, as we've seen a plethora of companies succeed under the leadership and employement
                        of gender-diverse companies. 23andMe, with 51:49 female to male ratio and guaranteed equal
                        gender pay, has made incredible progress in genetic research and achieved consistently
                        increasing profit over the past years. Likewise, Etsy, with 56% of female employees and 87%
                        women entrepreneurs, has revolutionized the way people buy and sell handmade goods and exceeded
                        Wall Street expectations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given these trends, it’s clear that gender disparity occurs at all parts of the journey to
                        become a contributor in tech and is worsening over the years. In addition to hiring,
                        inequalities should be addressed to support gender diversity.

                    <h2 class="post-title">Ethnicity</h2>
                    <p>The chart illustrates the ethnic breakdown for some of the top tech companies today, with the
                        default graph showing the breakdown for white employees. The first bar shows the population of
                        that race/ethnicity in the U.S., providing a point of reference.

                    <button class="button-7" role="button" onclick="update(black)">Black</button>

                    <!-- Create a div where the graph will take place -->
                    <div id="my_dataviz"></div>
                    <p> The data showed that Asians make up about 29% of tech employees, while only constituting 6% of
                        the US population. Latinos make up 18% of the U.S. population, but only around 7% of tech
                        employees. Similarly,
                        Black people make up 13% of the population, but only 5% of tech employees. This pattern persists
                        and becomes even greater in higher, leadership roles within companies. It is clear Latino and
                        Black people are under-represented minorities in tech.

                    </p>
                    <p> There are several problems that contribute to this discrepancy, including unequal access to
                        resources and implicit bias in the hiring process. There have been numerous studies which show
                        that employers are much more likely to call back applicants with “white” names than an applicant
                        with the same qualifications/resume but with “black” names. While more attention has been placed
                        on diversity and inclusion, there still remains a large gap for improvement.
